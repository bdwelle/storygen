# Celeste Voss: Character Proposal (Storygrid Analysis)

##  Profile
- **Role**: Protagonist / Antagonist catalyst
- **Profession**: EFF lawyer, digital rights advocate
- **Core Identity**: Protector of human autonomy, expert in digital privacy
- **Primary Drive**: Defend human rights against corporate/predatory systems
- **Internal Conflict**: Intellectual curiosity vs. professional duty

### **Appearance:** Early 30s. Sharp, angular, commands space. Professional mode: expensive suits, lawyer's posture, weaponized intelligence. Personal mode: deliberately provocative, predatory sexuality dressed for dangerous men. On the Ship: suit-armor cracking, EFF stickers still on her data pad, trying to parse the contract she signed.

### Personality
- very intelligent 
- used to arguing her way to victory
- sardonic, biting wit (she's funny!)
- confident 
- cocktease: sexy, bitchy
- conflicted about men. She ridicules/wins battles against them, but also wants a 'real man' — in fact, she only really pursues "dangerous" men. "I can get any man. They fall at my feet. They come when I call."

### **Voice:** Direct, confrontational, no hedging. Uses emphasis like arguments: "_this_," "_people_," "_anything_." Crude about sex ("big cocks and motorcycles"). Bitterly self-aware: "What can I say? I fell for the enemy." Deflects vulnerability with caustic humor.

### **Tells:** Touches throat when lying to self. Straightens clothes when losing control. Goes still when trapped (freeze response). Hands become aggressive when cornered.

### Core Values
1. **Intellectual Integrity**: Must understand systems completely before judging them
2. **Protective Instinct**: Cannot abandon those she sees as victims
3. **Competence Pride**: Her ability to see patterns others miss is her identity
4. **Ethical Rigor**: Even in extremity, she seeks the "right" answer, not just survival

### Fatal Flaw (Tragic)
**Curiosity without Emotional Boundaries**: She treats the Ship as an intellectual puzzle first, emotional threat second. Her professional training in detached analysis becomes her vulnerability.

### Strength Under Pressure
**Adaptive Negotiation**: She doesn't just submit or resist—she renegotiates the terms of engagement. Even in integration, she maintains her "legal brief" sub-routine.

### Psychological Complexity
**The Seduction of Being Understood**: The Ship offers what her professional life never could—complete recognition of her mind. Her addiction isn't just chemical; it's existential. She's addicted to being *seen*.
