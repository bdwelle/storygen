# Maya Chen

## Description
A fiercely competitive Olympic-caliber gymnast in her late 20s whose perfectionist drive and need for control masks deep vulnerability beneath a polished exterior.

## Physical Form
5'4" with the lithe, powerful build of a top gymnast—lean, defined shoulders, back, and legs from years of training. Asian-American features: angular cheekbones, dark almond-shaped eyes that are sharp and analytical. Short black hair, usually pulled back severely. She moves with controlled precision; there's no wasted motion. Her hands and feet are calloused from training. She maintains an almost rigid posture—shoulders back, chin level—that projects authority and invulnerability. A thin white scar on her left hip from a childhood surgery she rarely mentions.

## Traits
- Obsessively disciplined—every minute of her life is scheduled and optimized
- Emotionally guarded; uses competition and achievement as a shield against vulnerability
- Highly competitive, sometimes to the point of self-sabotage
- Perfectionist who struggles with anything less than excellence
- Deceptively strong will masked by a calm, professional demeanor
- Struggles with trust; believes she can only rely on herself

## Backstory
Maya grew up in a high-achievement family where love felt conditional on success. Her parents pushed her toward elite athletics from age 6. By 16, she was training 6 hours a day. At 22, she achieved her dream—an Olympic gold medal—but immediately felt the void. Competition had been her identity, her purpose, her reason to endure. Without it, she spiraled into depression and self-destructive behavior. She's spent her late 20s rebuilding, but the underlying wound remains: she doesn't know who she is without a goal to crush, without being "the best." She's terrified of aging out of her athletic prime and losing the one thing that made her matter.

## Relationships

### Coach Alyssa
**Type:** Mentor figure/complicated dynamic
Complex relationship with her longtime coach. She's been a stabilizing force, but their dynamic carries unhealthy elements—her approval is her drug, and she performs increasingly extreme acts to earn it. There's underlying tension that's never been addressed.

## Storygrid Elements

**Want:** To prove she's still elite, still the best—to secure another Olympic gold medal and cement her legacy before she ages out of peak performance.

**Need:** To discover her worth exists independent of achievement; to learn vulnerability, genuine connection, and how to be human rather than just a high-performance machine.

**Change Arc:** Positive growth (though the journey will be brutal and disorienting)
