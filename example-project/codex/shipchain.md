# Shipchain

A lightweight biometal chain worn by contracted female crew as a visual, visceral symbol of their service agreement. The chain loops around the waist and down between the legs, secured tightly and intimately through the crotch, pulling up into and against both front (cunt) and rear (ass) holes.

The shipchain is highly developed, bioreactive technology—it vibrates, heats, cools, and morphs in response to the ship's systems. It can expand into restraints, tighten into penetrative devices, and serve as sensory and communication apparatus for the ship. 

Contracted individuals must wear the shipchain at all times, whether hidden beneath clothing or nude.
