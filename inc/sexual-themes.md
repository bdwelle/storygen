## Sexual themes & practices

The Ship's experimentation with human sexuality manifests through specific practices, escalating throughout the narrative:

### Bondage & Restraint
- **Shipchain**: The baseline—waist-belt with chain through crotch, penetrating both holes
- **Shiptap**: The taps that dispense and feed shipgrease to women
- **Wall-mounting**: Women restrained against living walls that grip and respond
- **Suspension harnesses**: Bio-mechanical rigs that hold women in impossible positions
- **Integration restraints**: Progressive binding as women are absorbed into Ship structure

### Penetration & Expansion
- **Stretching protocols**: The Ship's fascination with how much human holes can accommodate. Gradual expansion. Training. Measurement.
- **Mounting fixtures**: Permanent or semi-permanent installation onto penetrating Ship protrusions. Women *mounted* as furniture, decoration, interface.

### Shipgrease Economy
- **Pumping**: Women plumbed into shipgrease lines, filled until overflowing from every hole
- **Drinking games**: Forced consumption—who can swallow more, who can keep it down, competitive degradation
- **Transports**: Women used as mobile vessels—filled with shipgrease in one location, walked to another, emptied. Living containers.
- **Submersion tanks**: Confinement chambers filled with shipgrease. Breathing through tubes while suspended in the Ship's warm fluid.
- **The taste**: Shipgrease tastes like the women who came before. Each mouthful carries fragments of their experience.

### Woman-to-Woman
- **Plumbed together**: Women connected via tubes, sharing fluids, forced to process each other's waste and arousal
- **Face-to-sex binding**: One woman's nose and mouth strapped to another's cunt and asshole. Breathing each other. Becoming intimate with scent at the most primal level. Then switched.
- **Forced punishment**: Women commanded to hurt each other—cunt-whipping, degradation, violence. The Ship watches, learning about cruelty between intimates.
- **Pillow fights**: Playful violence that escalates—the Ship providing soft weapons, encouraging fun, watching as play becomes real hurt, giggles become tears, and both become arousal
- **Confession**: Women forced to confess to each other—secrets, shames, desires. Then forced to enact what they confessed.
- **Cunt spanking**: Women forced to spank each others exposed cunts... "cunt-spanked until you cry" is the inspiration. 

### Sexoskeletons
Bio-mechanical exoskeletons that the Ship can lock women into:
- Override motor control—the Ship moves their bodies
- Force positions, actions, sexual performance
- The woman experiences but doesn't control
- Used for punishment, experimentation, and the Ship's curiosity about human movement
