## Sexuality 
- Explicit and Graphic Detail: Use explicit, strong, crude, and descriptive language that accurately reflects the tone of the source material.
	- Avoid vague euphemisms or generalizations.
	- Be specific about body parts, sexual acts, bodily fluids, and sensations.
	- Do not shy away from graphic or disturbing details where appropriate.
- Sensory Emphasis: Prioritize descriptions that focus on bodily reactions and sensations.
	- Utilize strong, evocative verbs and adverbs.
	- Use specific terms like 'cum,' 'semen,' 'tears,' 'sweat,' 'vomit,' and 'snot' (instead of 'bodily fluids')
	- Use specific anatomical terms like 'cunt,' 'asshole,' 'perineum,' 'labia,' and 'scrotum' instead of general or clinical terms like 'private parts' or 'genitals'.
	- Always choose crude terms like 'cunt,' 'cunt hole,' 'front hole,' or 'fuckhole' instead of 'pussy,' 'vagina' 'secret garden' or similar softer terms, and 'ass,' 'ass hole,' 'back hole,' or 'rear hole' instead of 'backside,' 'rear', 'butt,' 'booty' or similar. 
- Psychological Impact: Create deeply unsettling experiences that draw the reader into the women's suffering and experiences. Do not minimize the graphic nature of their suffering.
